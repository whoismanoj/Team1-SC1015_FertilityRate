# Welcome to Singapore - Fertility Rate Studies

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Singapore fertility rate (https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/births-and-fertility/visualising-data). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

## Motivation
Low fertility rates can have various negative consequences for a country, including an aging population, decreased economic growth, and social challenges. As the workforce decreases and the number of retirees increases, healthcare and pension costs may rise, while there may be a shortage of skilled workers. In addition, a shrinking population can affect a country's political and social stability, and change social norms and cultural values. Governments should therefore address this issue and encourage higher fertility rates through policies and programs that support families and child-rearing.

## Problem Definition

The fertility rate in Singapore has been steadily declining over the past few decades, which can lead to an aging population and economic and social challenges. To address this issue, we aim to analyze the factors that contribute to low fertility rates and predict the fertility rate in the next 10 years.

Specifically, we would like to explore the relationship between education level, cost of living, and rate of marriage and how it affects our fertility rate?

Lastly, We would like to predict what is the fertilty rate for the next 10 years.

## Models Used

**UPDATE THIS**
1. Logistic Regression
2. Neural Networks

## Conclusion

**UPDATE THIS**

- Popularity of the casts and crews have higher linear correlation value with ratings
- Resampling imbalanced data improved model performance especially on the minority class
- Logistic Regression did not perform well with non-linearly correlated variables
- Neural Networks along with SMOTEENN resampling method consistently did well in predicting good movies after 100 training attempts (around 72% accuracy, 70% recall)
- Yes, it is possible to predict if a movie is good with acceptable amount of accuracy and recall

## What did we learn from this project?
- Polynomial regression: a curved line to model the relationship between variables of a certain degree. It's useful for non-linear relationships, but can overfit and extrapolate beyond the data.
- Data visualization: We have created data visualizations to communicate insights and findings to better understand the case study.
- Data cleaning: We identified data quality issues such as missing data, duplicated records, or incorrect values. We then did a data cleaning and resampling.
