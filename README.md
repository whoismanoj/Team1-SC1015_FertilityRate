## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Singapore waste management (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kingabzpro/singapore-waste-management). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

## Problem Definition

- Are we able to predict if a movie is good (rating above 7.2) based on its attributes?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used

1. Logistic Regression
2. Neural Networks

## Conclusion

- Popularity and budget have low linear correlation value with ratings (watch out for bandwagons ðŸ¤£)
- Popularity of the casts and crews have higher linear correlation value with ratings
- Resampling imbalanced data improved model performance especially on the minority class
- Logistic Regression did not perform well with non-linearly correlated variables
- Neural Networks along with SMOTEENN resampling method consistently did well in predicting good movies after 100 training attempts (around 72% accuracy, 70% recall)
- Yes, it is possible to predict if a movie is good with acceptable amount of accuracy and recall

## What did we learn from this project?

- Handling imbalanced datasets using resampling methods and imblearn package
- Neural Networks, Keras and Tensorflow
- Logistic Regression from sklearn
- API Usage
- Other packages such as tqdm, json, requests
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Concepts about Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
