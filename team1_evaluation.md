My observations:
  - The problem formulation was good enough. It's a trivial one.
  - Data cleaning was done properly. Merging of various files are tedious but they have done good job.
  - Part 3 of the solutions contains EDA. EDA is based on different age group. The interval of 5 years is great.
  - Explanation for different plots are great but could have done better.
  - No reason is mentioned why polynomial regression is being used.
  - Slides are not bad. Could have presented better.
  - Most of the works are within syllabus.
  - Overall, the project is great!
